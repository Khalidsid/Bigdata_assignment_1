# Data Aggregation using relational database concepts of Pandas Library

There are four tables 
1. Users.csv contains data about the users of a social net
2. Friends.csv contains data about their friendship status
3. Posts.csv contains data about the posts they made
4. Reactions.csv contains data about the reactions to posts by their friends


Tasks 
Combine the tables in a way that lets you answer the following questions:
1. What is the most common age in the social network? How many people share it? [Data Filtering]
2. List the five people with least posts and reactions combined. (least active people) [Data Aggregation and Filtering]
3. Create a plot of the friendship graph (up to degree 2) for all users: named „Jean-Luc Picard“ - named „Jean-Luc Roth“ [Data Visualisation social media]
